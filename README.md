#  SwiftUI Accessibility

This project contains some examples of accessibility in SwiftUI

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Identify views with useful labels
- Hide and group accessibility data
- Read the value of controls

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
